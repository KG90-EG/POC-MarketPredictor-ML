# POC-MarketPredictor-ML Wiki

Use this wiki as a quick orientation for contributors. The canonical sources are the README and the docs directory inside the repo.

## Current Focus
- Harden the paper-trading simulation API and add regression tests.
- Plan the PostgreSQL migration and user authentication rollout.
- Validate deployments (Docker + hosted targets) with smoke tests and logging/metrics.

## Where to Start
- Backlog & owners: [`docs/project/backlog.md`](../docs/project/backlog.md)
- Architecture: [`docs/architecture/SPECIFICATION.md`](../docs/architecture/SPECIFICATION.md)
- Deployment: [`docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`](../docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)

Keep wiki notes in sync with those documents; avoid duplicating long specifications here.
