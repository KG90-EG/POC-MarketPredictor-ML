# Trading-Fun
Support Trading Decision

This repository contains a small machine learning pipeline and a reference frontend to generate a ranked list of tickers based on a model's probability of outperformance.

Quick summary:
- `trading_fun/` — Python package implementing data loading, features, model training, prediction, and a FastAPI server.
- `training/` — Retrain scripts, trainer and utilities (MLflow integration, drift-check, promotion)
- `backtest/` — A very small backtesting helper to simulate buy-hold trades.
- `frontend/` — React UI using Vite that shows ranked tickers from the backend `/ranking` endpoint.
- `01_Trading_Fun/` — Copied legacy content and tests
- `archive/` — Files archived and not used by the main flow

How to push to GitHub and PR (simple flow):
1. Make sure you have a GitHub repo: `KG90-EG/Trading-Fun`.
2. Commit & push on `dev` branch (we already created `dev` and pushed the changes):
```bash
git checkout dev
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: features + frontend"
git push -u origin dev
```
3. Open a PR to `main` using the web link (or `gh` CLI):
```
https://github.com/KG90-EG/Trading-Fun/pull/new/dev
```
4. Review & Merge PR (squash or merge commit) — GitHub Actions will run CI.

Deployment tips:
- Add GitHub secrets: `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`, `CR_PAT`, and `S3_BUCKET` if you wish to upload models.
- Configure your production environment to use `models/prod_model.bin` as the production model.
